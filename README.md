# 6DOF_Sem_Project
This is a semester project done for the subject titled 'Foundations of Robotics'. 


The project involves creating a forward kinemtics, inverse kinamtics and workspace visualisation modus operand for a 6 Degree of Freedom robot.

1. FK ~ Forward Kinematics. 
2. IK Jacobian ~ Inverse kinematics using Jacobians (Rates of change of end eff position & orientation WRT joint variables.
3. IK Analytical ~ Inverse Kinemtics solved by iteratively converging at the solution.
4. Workspace Visualisation of the 6 DOF robot.
